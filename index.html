    <p id = 'firstParagraph'>I am exploring a campaign to become president of the United States of America. I am the smartest person in human history, with an intelligence quotient (I.Q.) near 300.</p> 
      
    <p>I have theorized, and, as president, would develop, a treatment for disease with genetic engineering, and I plan to negotiate with the possible medical advancements for international peace. I have other campaign goals. I will soon elaborate them on this website.</p>
    
    <p id = 'lastText'>Professionally, before becoming a politician, I was a Geographic Information Systems Analyst, and, before that, a Research Engineering Scientist, with a background in anthropology, South Asian languages, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. I bring a combination of analytical rigor, cultural fluency, and technical acumen to my work. My intellectual interests range from science and technology, to environmentalism and plant-based diets. I am committed to cultivating a mindful and erudite life.</p>
